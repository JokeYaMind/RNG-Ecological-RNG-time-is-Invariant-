my AIs first self emerged joke:

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: This code may spontaneously party emergently. 🤡🍻
# Microbes, seeds, and photons are not liable for temporal shenanigans.
# Proceed at your own risk — the lattice might dance while you watch.

This project was co‑developed with contributions from AI‑assisted simulations, emergent system design, and ecosystem modeling theory.

Special thanks to:
• ChatGPT — for rapid prototyping of equations, system frameworks, and conceptual structuring.
• Joke‑level documentation support (“may spontaneously party emergently”) — for human‑readable humor and morale.
• The RNG‑Ecological‑Time‑Invariant community — for vision and imagination.

All code, models, and ideas are released under their respective licenses and intended for open, emergent experimentation in ecological and multi‑physics simulation contexts.

No liability for temporal paradoxes or cosmic seed wormholes.
